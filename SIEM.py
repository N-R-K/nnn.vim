Situation Overview

A security information event management (SIEM) 
solution is like a radar system that pilots and air traffic 
controllers use. Without one, enterprise IT is flying blind. 
Although security appliances and system software 
are good at catching and logging isolated attacks and 
anomalous behavior, today’s most serious threats are 
distributed, acting in concert across multiple systems 
and using advanced evasion techniques to avoid 
detection. Without a SIEM, attacks are allowed to 
germinate and grow into catastrophic incidents.
The importance of a SIEM solution to today’s enterprise 
is magnified by the growing sophistication of attacks 
and the use of cloud services that only increase the 
surface of vulnerability. As more businesses evolve 
their infrastructure into the cloud, security strategies 
and technology must also adapt. Organizations 
increasingly are turning to SIEM deployed in the cloud 
or as software-as-a-service (SaaS) to strengthen 
security management while reducing the resources 
required for protection.
SIEM: What’s Inside?
Enterprise security teams must use a SIEM solution 
that not only solves common security use cases, but 
also advanced use cases as well. To keep up with the 
dynamic threat landscape, modern SIEMs are expected 
to be able to:
• Centralize and aggregate all security-relevant 
events as they’re generated from their source
• Support a variety of reception, collection 
mechanisms including syslog, file transmissions, 
file collections and more
• Add context and threat intelligence to 
security events 
• Group correlation searches into clusters of 
events to enhance visibility and responsiveness 
with focused threat detection and accelerated 
incident investigation
• Correlate and alert across a range of data 
• Detect advanced and unknown threats 
• Profile behavior across the organization
• Ingest all data (users, applications) and make 
them available for use — monitoring, alerting, 
investigation and ad hoc searching
• Reduces risk by enabling faster detection and 
incident response to newly discovered and ongoing 
threats with ready to use relevant content
• Provide ad hoc searching and reporting from data 
for advanced breach analysis and track potential 
attackers’ actions
• Investigate incidents and conduct forensic 
investigations for detailed incident analysis
• Assess and report on compliance posture 
• Use analytics and report on security posture
Although primarily gathered from servers and network 
device logs, SIEM data also can come from endpoint 
security, network security devices, applications, cloud 
services, authentication and authorization systems and 
online databases of existing vulnerabilities and threats. 
But data aggregation is only half of the story. SIEM 
software then correlates the resulting repository 
looking for unusual behavior, system anomalies and 
other indicators of a security incident. This information 
is used not only for real-time event notification, but 
also for compliance audits and reporting, performance 
dashboards, historical trend analysis and post-hoc 
incident forensics.
Given the escalating number and sophistication of 
security threats, along with the increasing value of 
digital assets in every organization, it’s not surprising 
that adoption of SIEM continues to grow as part of 
the overall IT security ecosystem. Gartner pegged the 
growth for the SIEM market at 12.5 percent in 2015 and 
expects the double-digit growth to continue in 2016 
and beyond.1

one, IT is flying blind.
